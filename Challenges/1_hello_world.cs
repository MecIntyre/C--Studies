/* Output: This is the first line.
           This is the second line.

   Use the two different techniques to print the two lines of the output. 
   In other words, you learned how to display a message in just one line of code, 
   and you learned how to display a message using multiple lines of code. Use both techniques for this challenge. 
   It doesn't matter which technique you apply to which line, 
   and it doesn't matter how many ways you split one of the messages into multiple lines of code. 
   That's your choice. */


// One possible solution:
Console.WriteLine("This is the first line.");

Console.Write("This is ");
Console.Write("the second ");
Console.Write("line.");
