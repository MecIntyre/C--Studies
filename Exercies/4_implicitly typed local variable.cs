// Direct declaration of a local variable and assign of a string value
var message = "Hello world!";


// You can only use the var keyword if the variable is initialized
// The var keyword tells the compiler to infer the data type of the variable based on the value it is initialized to.
// You'll likely see the var keyword as you read other people's code; however, you should use the data type when possible.
